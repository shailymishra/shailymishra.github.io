      abstract={In resource allocation, it is common to assume that agents have a utility for their allocated items and zero utility for unallocated ones. We refer to such valuation domain as 1-D. This assumption of zero utility for unallocated items is not always reasonable. Especially when items are indispensable people consume them at the cost of others' utility. In general different externalities can affect an agent's utility, i.e., if an agent doesn't receive an item, it can result in their gain (positive externalities) or loss (negative externalities). The existing preference models do not capture the setting with these externalities.  We conduct a study on a 2-D domain, where each agent has a utility ($v$) for an item assigned to it and utility ($v'$) for an item not allocated to it. We consider fair and efficient allocation of both goods and chores. There already exists various notions of fairness and algorithms for 1-D domain. We observe that adapting the existing fairness notion or the algorithm to 2-D is not always trivial. 
We propose a utility transformation ($T_u$) to convert from the 2-D domain to 1-D, i.e., the existing domain. We then analyze if a given fairness and efficiency property can be retained under this transformation. That is, if a property satisfied in 1-D domain is also satisfied in 2-D domain after transformation, and vice versa. If a property is retainable, we can apply the transformation, and adapt the existing algorithms seamlessly to 2-D domain. We also mention few properties which although cannot be retained through transformation yet the existing algorithms can still be applied. We explore fairness notions such as Envy-freeness (EF), Equitability (EQ), Maxmin Share (MMS), and Proportionality and efficiency notions such as Pareto Optimality, Utilitarian Welfare, Nash Welfare, and Egalitarian Welfare.  }
