Hi!

<!-- I am Shaily. I am an MS Student in [Machine Learning Lab, IIIT-Hyderabad](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Dr. Sujit Gujar](https://www.sujitgujar.com/). I am broadly interested in solving game-theoretic settings with theoretical limitations using Machine Learning. I am keen to explore other domains as well, such as Graph Neural Networks. And I like teaching. -->
