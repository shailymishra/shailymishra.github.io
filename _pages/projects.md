Machine Learning

___

* __Supervised Learning__ [[Code]](https://github.com/shailymishra/) 
    - Classified MNIST dataset using MAP, MLE, Bayesian pairwise, and perpendicular bisectors to understand the fundamentals of data and classification.
    - Classified Face using six different features (Eigen Face, Fisher Face, KernelPCA, Kernel Fisher Face, VGG Face, ResNet) by training MLP classifier on Yale Face, Indian Movie Face, and IIT-CFW Database and used t-SNE for face visualization. 
    - Implemented data dimensionality reduction using PCA and ISOMAP on the CIFAR-10 dataset and classified using SVM.

___

- __Unsupervised Learning__  [[Code]](https://github.com/shailymishra/)
    - Implemented Manifold learning methods - MDS, LLE, and ISOMAP. Performed k-means and spectral clustering on the Concentric Circles and Swiss roll dataset and visualized using manifold in 2-D. 

___

- __Reinforcement Learning__   [[Code]](https://github.com/shailymishra/) 
    - Formulated modified version of BlackJack and Walk-Tram Problem as MDP, and learned to play using Value Iteration and Q-Learning in Python.
___

- __Decentrailized Application__  [[Code]](https://github.com/shailymishra/)
    - Created dAPP for two games (Battlefiled and Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock) using MEAN framework, and solidity for smart contracts in team of two).

___

- __j__ 
[[Code]](https://github.com/HareeshBahuleyan/seizure-prediction-kaggle) <br>
  <p style="text-align:justify">EEG signals record electrical activity of the brain and can be used to predict the onset of a seizure. A competition conducted by the University of Melbourne on Kaggle required participants to classify 10-minute EEG clips into clips into either interictal or pre-ictal. I appoached the problem using an XGBoost classifier trained on (1) Time domain features, (2) Frequency domain features, and (3) EEG Specific Features. </p>

___

- __Text Classification using LSTMs__ 
[[Code]](https://github.com/HareeshBahuleyan/deeplearning-tutorials/tree/master/text-classification-lstm) <br>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Carry out a sentiment analysis task on the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset using recurrent neural networks. Specifically, an LSTM was trained with sentences (sequence of words) to predict the sentiment label.</p>

___

- __Airbnb Rental Price Prediction__ 
[[Code]](https://github.com/HareeshBahuleyan/airbnb-analysis) <br>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Python Selenium is used to scrape listings data from airbnb.ca for the city of Toronto. An extensive exploratory data analysis is carried out, following which, a price prediction model is built using information such as in-house amenitites and neighbourhood facilites as features.</p>
